    "The dynamic history of the island of Krk was determined by its favourable geographical position (the crossroads of merchant routes),",
    "mild climate, sufficient amount of arable land and a considerable number of hills for fortifying the villages. Its earliest traces date back",
    "into prehistory. Although the remains of this ancient past have not yet been adequately investigated, they were found on strategically positioned",
    "hills (around the church of St Peter in Gabonjin) and in the caves of the island of Krk. The period of Roman domination left many traces on the island",
    "of Krk, preserved below Omišalj at the archaeological site Fulfinum, in the cove Soline around the Medieval church of St Peter and within the today’s",
    "cities Baška and Krk. The best preserved traces of Roman culture are located in the catering facilities Volsonis and Mate in the city of Krk. The café",
    "Volsonis is incorporated into the Roman walls of the city and the café Mate has an excellently preserved Roman mosaic showing the mythical creature Triton.",
    "The earliest traces of Christianity originate from the fifth century, when the religion was accepted by the Empire. That is when the important sacral",
    "buildings were built along the very centres of power of the late Antiquity. The earliest and best-preserved edifices are the old Christian basilica in",
    "Mirine built next to the Roman city Fulfinum, the remains of the old Christian church below the church of St Marco in Baška and the remains of a very",
    "early sacral edifice found in the foundations of the Krk cathedral.",
    "The today’s island of Krk is divided into seven municipalities with larger towns as administrative centres: Omišalj, Malinska, Dobrinj, Vrbnik, Krk,",
    "Punat and Baška. The similar division of the island, except for Punat and Malinska which are younger, has been preserved since the Middle Ages when the",
    "island castles were managed by the princely family Frankopan under the watchful eye of Venice. The family Frankopan took care of preserving the peace on",
    "the island, proper arrangement of legal relations, cherishing the tradition through the Croatian language and the Glagolitic script, as well as maintaining",
    "the sacral objects necessary for liturgical purposes. The old Frankopan castle-fortress called Gradec has been preserved near the village Vrbnik, while the",
    "city of Krk contains a grand Frankopan castle, a representative defensive structure and a constituent part of the city walls.",
    "The uncertainty of the Middle Ages stimulated the construction of villages at high places so their geographical position would provide the possibility of",
    "control over the arable land and the protection from possible assaults. The city walls were preserved only in Krk, while in other villages, like Dobrinj,",
    "traces of walls can only be seen within the thick walls of the houses located in the outer ring of the town. Island villages have still preserved some",
    "recognizable elements of traditional masonry in small stone houses radially set on narrow streets around the main city square, with the bell towers of local",

    "Significant changes ensued in the second decade of the 19th century when such form of voluntary religious liturgy was abolished and the church was left",
    "to the care of the population. After 1927 masses ceased to be held in the church, as the function of the main village church in Sužan was taken over by the",
    "nearby church of the Our Lady of Health.Župna crkva Uznesenja Blažene Djevice Marije i zvonik",
    "Although the church is relatively young, still a few stages of construction and reconstruction can be seen. The original Renaissance church had small dimensions,",
    "then an apse was added on the east side, and an entry porch on the west side (loggia, “lopica”). The western façade has a distaff with three bells and a stone",
    "staircase leading to the roof. There was a cemetery near the church and a small edifice east of the apse, which probably used to be an auxiliary cemetery object.",
    "Although it is today abandoned and situated at the end of the village, this church speaks figuratively about its five hundred year old past and represents a",

    "of St George operated in the church.",
    "The church is a single-nave edifice with a prominent semicircular apse on the east. The southern wall is made of visible rectangular dressed stones in",
    "regular layers. The remains of the church indicate the Romanesque style of construction, recognizable in a series of island churches. There are no visible",

    "by the prince Ivan Frankopan from 1465, in which it was called “the land of St Peter”. It is located at the extremely important site of the Medieval",

    "The church of St Peter is preserved in a derelict condition, but still a few stages of construction can be recognized – pre-Romanesque and later",
    "Romanesque-Gothic adaptation indicated by the triumphal arch, which is when the church was considerably expanded. Western façade is simple, with a",
    "distaff on the roof. The oldest church walls are on its extreme eastern part so it is supposed to be the place of the former small pre-Romanesque church.",

    "single-nave structure with semicircular apse protruding on the east side, the walls of which are made of dressed stones laid in regular layers.",
    "This way of masonry, the dimension and form of the edifice are characteristic for Romanesque churches, made from the 12th until the 13th century.",
    "Still, the findings of decorative stone reliefs indicate its slightly earlier emergence, in the 11th century. In the later stage of construction,",
    "a smaller rectangular addition was added on the northern side of the church. The thickness of the walls indicates that this was a high structure,",
    "probably a bell tower. The church is on a dominant position, offering a view of the channel, so the bell tower obviously served to alarm the",
    "population of the nearby city of Krk in case of incoming danger from the sea.",
    "A significant finding was discovered east of the church, near the apse. Here, in a live rock rising about fifty centimetres above the ground level,",
    "a deep pit was discovered, which may be interpreted as a natural well. There are visible traces of dressing on the rock, which made this inaccessible",

    "with his brothers from the incoming storm in the harbour along the church of the Mother of God. According to the legend, this is where they found a",
    "hermit who was taught about the rules of their order. The hermit accepted those rules and they became the basis of the establishment of the Franciscan",

    "of several masters. The centre of the mosaic is dominated by the mythological being Triton, with a human body and a fish tail. Triton is the sea deity,",
    "the son of Poseidon and the Nereid Amphitrite. It is surrounded by images of sea fauna, dolphins and fish with stylized dragon-like features. It is",

    "The container is held by another mythological being with a human torso, horse legs and a fish tail, probably an Ichthyocentaurus. Owing to the damage of",
    "the mosaic, only his mane and trident in the left hand can be recognized. The merry atmosphere and the content of the illustration indicate that this is a",
    "scene of a sea feast.",
    "The third mythological being is also preserved only in traces. This is probably Hermes’ son Pan. This is indicated by the illustration of the syrinx with",
    "which he contributed to the atmosphere of the feast.",
    "By establishing the existence of the three figures, Triton, Ichthyocentaurus and Pan, completely equal in their presentation, standing approximately at",
    "the same distance from each other, we get the impression that the fourth figure is missing, the one that would complete the image of the entire sea feast.",
